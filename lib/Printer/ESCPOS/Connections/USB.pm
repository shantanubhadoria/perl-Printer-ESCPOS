= SYNOPSIS

For using the printer in USB mode you will need to get a few details for your printer.

retrieve the ~vendorId~ and ~productId~ params using the lsusb command

    shantanu@shantanu-G41M-ES2L:~$ lsusb
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp.
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8008 Intel Corp.
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub

    Bus 003 Device 005: ID 413c:2111 Dell Computer Corp.
    Bus 003 Device 004: ID 046d:c03e Logitech, Inc. Premium Optical Wheel Mouse (M-BT58)
    Bus 003 Device 009: ID 1cbe:0002 Luminary Micro Inc.
    Bus 003 Device 007: ID 0cf3:0036 Atheros Communications, Inc.
    Bus 003 Device 008: ID 1504:0006
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

My printer shows up at the second to last line in the list.

    Bus 003 Device 008: ID 1504:0006

The ~vendorId~ and ~productId~ for my printer is 0x1504 and 0x0006 respectively

Now to get the ~endPoint~ value for my printer I use this command:

    shantanu@shantanu-G41M-ES2L:~/test$ sudo lsusb -vvv -d 1504:0006 | grep bEndpointAddress | grep OUT
            bEndpointAddress     0x01  EP 1 OUT

The endpoint address is 0x01 which is the default for the module.

Now you have all the values you need for your printer to work in USB mode.

    $device = Printer::ESCPOS->new(
        driverType => 'USB',
        vendorId   => 0x1504,
        productId  => 0x0006,
        endPoint   => 0x01,   # There is no need to specify endPOint in
                              # this case as 0x01 is the default value
    );
    $device->printer->text("Blah Blah\n");
    $device->printer->print();
